# dev-pipes

A decentralized project management app with automatic payment flows.

## How does it work

1. Anybody with a wallet can create a project with a description of what needs delivering
2. A total budget for the project is specified
3. Other people can then break down the project in their own way to create subprojects
4. The subprojects define how much will be paid for each task
5. The subprojects can be broken down recursively in the same way
6. Developers can then implement the sub projects.
7. When the project and subproject conditions are met all the developers in the tree can collect their payments
