# Dev Pipes

A decentralized project management app with automatic payment flows.

## Unstoppable Domains Integration

Login with Unstoppable is integrated as part of the [Gitcoin Hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/issue/unstoppabledomains/gitcoin-bounties/4/100027487).

Use the [Application](https://dev-pipes.vercel.app/)

View the [Code](https://github.com/ben-razor/dev-pipes/blob/main/web_react/src/App.js)  

Check out the [Demo Video](https://youtu.be/u6xLRlKB7nc) 

Note that Unstoppable login cannot be used on a local version as it redirects to the live application.

## Concept

1. Anyone with a wallet can create a project with a description of what needs delivering
2. A total budget for the project is specified
3. Other people can then break down the project in their own way to create subprojects
4. The subprojects define how much will be paid for each task
5. The subprojects can be broken down recursively in the same way
6. Developers can then implement the sub projects.
7. When the project and subproject conditions are met all the developers in the tree can collect their payments
